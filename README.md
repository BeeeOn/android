# BeeeOn - Android Application

BeeeOn's Android application is currently the primary graphical interface for the end-user. It allows user to register his BeeeOn gateway, to pair sensors and actuators, to share his BeeeOn home system with other users and to manage their rights. The target of this application is to provide user:

- a customizable dashboard that will provide a quick overview over his BeeeOn system
- complete list of his gateways and connected devices
- localization in various languages (currently English, Czech, Slovak)
- dedicated algorithms such as watchdog, weather forecast, healthy home environment and others

Please be aware that the namespace of the BeeeOn application is *com.rehivetech.beeeon*. RehiveTech is a commercial company that build the hardware as well as funded publication of this Android application on Google Play. This application is available publicly free of charge.

## Compilation

Checkout source code here from Github and then import project in *Android Studio* as usual. To correctly compile the app, make sure to copy and rename file *BeeeOn/app/src/main/res/values/api_keys.xml.EXAMPLE* to *api_keys.xml*, open it and uncomment the strings and fill them with your own data (but compilation itself should work even with dummy values).
